# SOAR-EDR-Project

### Objective

The goal of this project is to create a security automation system leveraging SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) capabilities and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools. The project integrates LimaCharlie, Slack, and Tines to automate incident detection, alerting, and response workflows for Windows Server 2025.

### Skills Learned

- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) configuration.
- SOAR playbook design and automation.
- Event monitoring and rule-based threat detection.
- Incident response using automated workflows.

### Tools Used

- Windows Server 2025: Endpoint for generating events using LaZagne tool.
- LimaCharlie: EDR tool for managing sensors, creating detection rules, and triggering responses.
- Slack: Alerting and communication channel for incidents.
- Tines: Platform for designing and automating incident response playbooks.

### Playbook Workflow

1) Detection Retrieval: A LimaCharlie webhook detects a suspicious event.
2) Alerting: The details (e.g., title, username, source IP) are sent to Slack and email.
3) Decision Prompt: Admins receive a Slack prompt asking if the affected machine should be isolated.
   - No Response: Sends a Slack message indicating no action taken.
   - Yes Response: Executes LimaCharlie isolation and sends the status update to Slack.
